I'm curious about other type of language, and have a discussion with AI. I ask this question since when I tried to build my website with jeykll on my WSL system, it fails and had a lot of errors, and I tried to update some package but it is quite complicated, and then AI told me to use hugo and say that this is more stable.

Hugo is more stable since this is build (and compiled) by go lang, and this is a compiled code, so its depedency is smaller and can be used in more system. Other compile code are C++, rusts. This type of language can be stable across OS/CI.

For jeykll, it is a gem (just like package imported in python), and bundle is the version comtrol (similar to pip requirements in python), and this is written by ruby (an interpreted language, same as python). It might be more flxeible but would have a larger dependency and may come up with more error during execution.

Fpr users, AI state that jeykll is used by early github pages, and hugo are more used in recent project and promoted by engineers.

After knowing this, I tried to ask more information about go lang and it seems to be an interesting language, and I think I may try to study this some day.
